This project implements a baseline convolutional neural network (CNN) model for classifying clothing items in the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

**Project Outline:**

Fashion MNIST Clothing Classification: Leverages the Fashion-MNIST dataset containing images of various clothing items.

Model Evaluation Methodology: Uses K-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

Baseline Model Development: Defines a simple CNN architecture using Keras.

Improved Model Development: This section is currently empty but could include enhancements like hyperparameter tuning or exploring different architectures.

Finalization and Prediction:Instructions for finalizing the model and making predictions are not yet provided.

**Code Structure:**

load_dataset: Loads the Fashion-MNIST training and test datasets.

prep_pixels: Preprocesses the image data by converting pixel values to floats and normalizing them.

define_model: Defines the baseline CNN model architecture.

evaluate_model: Performs K-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

summarize_diagnostics: Plots learning curves for the training and validation sets.

summarize_performance: Calculates and visualizes the model's accuracy distribution.

run_test_harness: Loads the dataset, preprocesses data, evaluates the model, and summarizes performance.

**Running the Project:**

Ensure you have Python 3 and the required libraries (Keras, NumPy, etc.) installed.

Run the script: python3 fashion_mnist_cnn.py

**Next Steps:**

Develop an improved model by experimenting with different architectures or hyperparameters.

Implement model finalization and prediction functionalities.

Consider adding documentation for potential improvements and future project directions.
